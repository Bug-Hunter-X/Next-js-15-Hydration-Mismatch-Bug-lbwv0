# Next.js 15 Hydration Mismatch Bug

This repository demonstrates a common bug in Next.js 15 applications related to hydration mismatches. Hydration mismatches occur when the server-side rendering (SSR) output and the client-side rendering (CSR) output differ, leading to errors and unexpected behavior.  The bug is caused by inconsistencies between the server-rendered content and the client-rendered content, triggered when client-side data fetching updates the UI structure. 

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Open your browser and observe the console for errors.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that the client-side updates don't change the structure of the component in unexpected ways. This typically requires careful use of conditional rendering and state management to maintain consistency between server-side and client-side rendering.
